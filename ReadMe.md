**RAFTiNG** is a Raft algorithm implementation in .Net.

Overview
========
As of now RAFTiNG is still on the early stages and I am ironing out the intended service. But the main objective is to implement trustworthy services helping developers build their clustering/load balancing/fault tolerance.

Zookeeper is a clear reference, and Raft was chosen because of the understandability first approach. RAFTiNG follows that road too and aims at simplicity and understandability.
